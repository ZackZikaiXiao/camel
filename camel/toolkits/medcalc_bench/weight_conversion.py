def weight_conversion_explanation(weight_info):
    """
    Converts a patient's weight from different units (pounds, grams, or kilograms) to kilograms and generates an explanatory text.

    Parameters:
        weight_info (tuple): A tuple containing two elements:
            - First element (float): The patient's weight value.
            - Second element (str): The unit of weight, which can be one of the following:
                - "lbs" for pounds.
                - "g" for grams.
                - "kg" for kilograms.

    Returns:
        tuple: Contains two elements:
            - First element (str): An explanatory text describing the conversion process and result.
            - Second element (float): The converted weight value (in kilograms).

    Notes:
        - Uses the `round_number` function to round the result.
        - If the input unit is not "lbs," "g," or "kg," the function defaults to returning the input value as kilograms.

    Example:
        convert_weight((150, "lbs"))
        output: "The patient's weight is 150 lbs so this converts to 150 lbs * 0.453592 kg/lbs = 68.04 kg."

    answer = round_number(weight * 0.453592)

    if weight_label == "lbs":
        return f"The patient's weight is {weight} lbs so this converts to {weight} lbs * 0.453592 kg/lbs = {answer} kg. ", answer
